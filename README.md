# Daily Python Practice For Data Roles

This repo contains daily Python questions â€” mainly focused on roles like **Data Analyst** and **Data Scientist**.

Each day, I add 10 questions (with solutions) that help build logic, improve problem-solving, and get used to questions often asked in interviews or tests.

### What's Included:
- Jupyter Notebook with daily questions
- Covers basic to intermediate Python
- Focused on practical, data-related problems

### Contributions Welcome!
If youâ€™re also preparing for data roles and want to add your own questions or improve existing ones feel free to contribute!

Letâ€™s help each other grow ðŸŒ±
